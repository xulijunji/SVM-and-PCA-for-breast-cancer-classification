# SVM-and-PCA-for-breast-cancer-classification
I am able to substantially compress the sklearn breast cancer data set by reducing the many features in this dataset down to just two principle components. The compressed data set is nicely classified using a SVM (fed by linear kernel), resulting in a prediction accuracy of over 95%.   

The dataset for this project is imported from sklearn.
